# Chillpill

Chillpill is a digital prescription service used by doctors to generate and share prescriptions for patients and manage patients' medical reports paperlessly.

We used raw `PHP` with `MySQL` database as our backend and for our frontend, We’ve used `HTML`, `CSS` with `SASS`, `Tailwindcss`, and a component library called `DaisyUI`.

## Features
✅ Search suggestions of available medicines\
✅ Sending prescription to the Patient's mobile via SMS\
✅ Analytical dashboard for the Doctors to see Patients' history
